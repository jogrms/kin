## Usage

```clojure
(use 'kin.core)
(use 'kin.mixins)
```

Suppose that you are trying to define a reqursive version of fib and apply
memoization to it.
You can start by defining a recursive fib generator using the `defgen` macro:

```clojure
(defgen fib [x]
  (if (< x 2)
    1
    (+ (fib (dec x))
       (fib (- x 2)))))
```

`defgen` uses the same syntax as `defn` but produces a generator along with the function.
You can use `fib` as a regular function:

```clojure
(fib 4)
;; => 5
```

Or you can extract the generator using the `gen` function and compute the fixed point using `fix`:

```clojure
((-> fib gen fix) 4)
;; => 5
```

Now let's define a version of fib that traces all the calls and parameters using the
`trace` mixin:

```clojure
(def fib-trace (inherit fib (trace 'fib)))

(fib-trace 4)
;; (fib 4)
;; (fib 3)
;; (fib 2)
;; (fib 1)
;; (fib 0)
;; (fib 1)
;; (fib 2)
;; (fib 1)
;; (fib 0)
;; => 5
```

And memoization using the `memo` mixin:

```clojure
(def fib-trace-memo (inherit fib-trace (memo)))
;; or
(def fib-trace-memo* (inherit fib (trace 'fib) (memo)))

(fib-trace-memo 4)
;; (fib 4)
;; (fib 3)
;; (fib 2)
;; (fib 1)
;; (fib 0)
;; => 5

(fib-trace-memo 4)
;; => 5
```
